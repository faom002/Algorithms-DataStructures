Introduction
This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of various algorithms and data structures commonly used in computer science and software development. By implementing and analyzing these algorithms and data structures, you can gain a deeper understanding of their inner workings, performance characteristics, and potential use cases.

Implemented Algorithms
The following algorithms and data structures have been implemented in this project:

Linear Search: An algorithm to search for a specific element in an array by iterating through each element sequentially.
Binary Trees: A hierarchical data structure composed of nodes, where each node can have at most two children.
Depth-First Search (DFS): A graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
Breadth-First Search (BFS): A graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order.
Bubble Sort: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
Merge Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides a list into smaller sublists, sorts them, and then merges them back into a single sorted list.
Quick Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays, one with elements less than the pivot and one with elements greater than the pivot.
Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/faom002/Algorithms-DataStructures.git
Ensure you have Java installed on your machine.
Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
Usage
Each algorithm and data structure is implemented in a separate Java file, making it easy to navigate and understand each concept. The source code is well-documented and includes comments explaining the logic behind the implementations.

To run and test the algorithms and data structures, simply execute the relevant Java file in your IDE or through the command line.

java FileName.java

Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different inputs to observe the behavior and performance of each algorithm and data structure.
